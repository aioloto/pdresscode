As a developer, I am constantly seeking the most screen real estate possible. As a student, I cannot afford to upgrade to the newest MBP model to get the multitude of video output options offered with the Mini DisplayPort, Thunderbolt, and HDMI outputs.  Alas, I was met with a predicament - **How can I make use of the two 24" monitors that I've collected so that I can have two equal-sized monitors when I am working?**

After some serious investigation into my options, I settled on the Aluratek AUH200F USB 2.0-to-HDMI adapter that has proven its worth over the past year and a half. This piece of equipment has been great for helping me maximize screen space, giving me lots of options for organzing my PDFs and documentation, IDEs, text editors, terminals, Slack, and various other applications that I like to have available in my view when working away at school work, side projects, or even remotely for my work (nothing beats getting paid to work in your pajamas).

The Aluratek adapter supports up to 1920 x 1080 widescreen monitors in extended (i.e. what we want), mirrored, or primary modes. A USB to micro-USB connection is used to connect the MacBook to the Aluratek device, which provides an HDMI output that can be connected to your external display as desired. 

Although I'll admit this adapter is not suited for powering a monitor for which you want a high refresh rate (e.g. for gaming), it is perfect for powering a display that you want to use to house a text-editor, PDF editor, documentation in your browser, or a terminal. I've even tested it viewing videos using VLC and QuickTime, and both have performed well. For applications that require a higher refresh rate, when paired with your typical Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter and another external monitor, this combination can definitely be a productive powerhouse and supercharge your "aging" Macbook Pro.

One problem to note that I ran into when first setting up, is that the drivers that came with the packaged CD did not work on OSX Yosemite. This was solved with a simple search where I found updated [DisplayLink drivers](http://www.displaylink.com/downloads/mac_downloads.php).
